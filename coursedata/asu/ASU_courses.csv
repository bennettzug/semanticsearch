ANT,3560,Archaic States,"Archaeology is uniquely positioned to explore the (pre)history of complex political regimes-what we now call the State-through the study of material culture, human remains, and spatial order. This course will adopt a comparative approach to “archaic” forms of the State as we address three interrelated questions: How does the State emerge in different times and places over the past several millennia? How does the State draw on diverse sources of power to institute the authority of the few over the many? And how does the State intersect with social identities and communities of people subject to or beyond its rule? We will also consider whether our own experience of political power must always frame our responses to these questions-in other words, how can archaeology offer historical visions of the State that are not simply crude reflections of the modern world? Schedule type: Seminar",3
ANT,3600,Archaeological Theory,"How do archaeologists interpret the past from the material artifacts and sites we uncover in the present? How do our interpretations speak to wider anthropological discussions of human biology, history, language, and culture? And does archaeology matter? In this course we address these questions through a critical foray into the conceptual and theoretical foundations of anthropological archaeology-from its colonial roots, through its maturation as a discipline in the 20th century, to its ongoing diversification today. We also explore how archaeology draws on and contributes to public conversations and intellectual trends across the social sciences and humanities.",3

ANT,3680,Environmental Anthropology,"This course explores how anthropologists understand the human and cultural dimensions of environmental problems. Or, to put it another way, the intersection of nature and culture. Environmental anthropologists examine how different sociocultural groups - from hunter-gatherers in the Amazon to rangers in national parks in the United States - have conceptualized, categorized, valued, and acted upon the non-human world. We will explore theories, methods, and applications of environmental anthropology. The field examines issues of vital concern today: how humans shape and are shaped by our surroundings.",3
ANT,3800,Ethnographic Writing,"The general purpose of this course is to explore the nature of ethnographic representation and alternative approaches to writing. In order to accomplish this, the course will focus on three main activities: (1) reading of some current critiques and analyses of ethnographic representation; (2) reading different forms of ethnographic writing by others, including realist, confessional and impressionist tales; and (3) writing different forms of ethnographic writing.",3
ANT,3820,Anthropology of Media,"In this course, we consider from an anthropological perspective the nature and force of mass media in cultural life. The anthropology of media can be understood as a natural history of the human senses in relation to science and technology, while additionally considering these shifts in connection to social and political phenomena. As we map this particular history of the senses primarily through ethnographies and other literary forms, we want to keep in mind these questions: (1) What structural, psychic, and social forms of life are made possible by the technologization, and more recently, the electronification of communication in various milieus? (2) How does the materiality of media itself transform the human experience of space-time? (3) What is the role of media in the production of difference and understandings of the self? This is a theory-driven course with a lab component, where students will be asked to explore philosophical questions through multimedia projects produced in the Ethnography Lab.",3

The course is structured to provide students with a hands-on experience in collecting, processing, and analyzing linguistic data for the purposes of language documentation and description. By the end of the course, participants will have become familiar-not just with the structure of an unfamiliar language-but also with the basic methodologies of linguistic fieldwork (elicitation and text analysis).",3
ANT,4225,Meaning,"Culture is often described generally as a system of shared meanings. Using semiotic and existential-phenomenological approaches in anthropology, this seminar will look not so much at WHAT the meanings are that people may share, but rather at the WAYS in which meanings are conveyed, silenced, changed, and imagined by human beings in their cultural contexts.",3
ANT,4230,Magic and Modernity,"Modernity is often characterized by a constellation of features such as rationality, objectivity, linear time, bureaucracy, and progress. Anthropology arose as a discipline of modernity. Yet many of the worlds that anthropologists study are enchanted worlds where the dead speak, ghosts act, and magic works. This seminar analyzes what happens when modernity meets such enchanted modes of human existence and explores how anthropology might grapple with the problem of using rational methods to understand magical worlds.",3

An example of this disconnect between policy discourse, policy, and educational realities can be seen when politicians and policies perpetually set out to change education while many perceive that education is still “failing.” In this course, we will consider the ways policy looks different depending on your perspective - how the building and understanding of policy knowledge is influenced by power. We will engage with the ideas, the concepts of democracy that we use - to understand how our thinking frameworks impact both how we understand an issue and how we then formulate responses. To root our collective understanding of ‘policy problems,’ the course will begin with a brief introduction to the policy world - considering educational as well as social, economic, and environmental issues. We will continue to think about the frameworks or discourses surrounding them, considering the policy documents and processes, but also the lived experiences of those affected to critically examine how policy and our frameworks for understanding policy can be a major driver in the reproduction of inequality.
